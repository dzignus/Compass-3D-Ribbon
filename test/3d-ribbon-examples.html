<h1>3D CSS Ribbon</h1>

<p>A Sass/Compass plugin by Leandro D'Onofrio</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>This is a ribbon with the default styles:</p>

<!--Default ribbon -->
<h3 class="ribbon ribbon-default">Default ribbon</h3>

<p>There are a number of options to change the appearance of the ribbon like the colors, backgrounds and position of the ribbon's overlap:</p>

<!--Custom ribbon 1 -->
<h3 class="ribbon ribbon-custom-1">Ribbon with custom options</h3>

<p>For example, you can change the position the ribbon's overlap to the top...</p>

<!--Custom ribbon 2 -->
<h3 class="ribbon ribbon-custom-2">← The overlap is on the top →</h3>

<p>or have only one overlap...</p>

<!--Custom ribbon 3 -->
<h3 class="ribbon ribbon-custom-3">← The overlap is on the left</h3>

<p>even create the overlap's back adding some span elements...</p>

<!--Custom ribbon 4 -->
<h3 class="ribbon ribbon-custom-4">
  ← The back's overlap on both sides →
  <span class="ribbon-left"></span>
  <span class="ribbon-right"></span>
</h3>

<p>and finally some fancy example:</p>

<!--Fancy example -->
<div class="fancy">
  <h2>
    <span class="ribbon-center">Bendin' <br> in the Wind</span>
    <span class="ribbon-left"></span>
    <span class="ribbon-right"></span>
  </h2>
  <p>The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. So, how 'bout them Knicks? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.</p>
